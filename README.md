### Region: New York, USA
The state of New York is a highly industrialized, densely populated are with diverse economic and housing trends. I chose this region for the project due to its blend of urban and rural areas (especially with the inclusion of major city, New York City), allowing for analysis of cost-of-living factors like household income, housing prices, unemployment rates, and gas prices. This data can help better understand the economic pressures of being a resident of New York.

### Datasets
The analysis utilizes three datasets that detail various economic metrics over time:
1. Median Household Income: The annual median income for households across New York.
2. Median Housing Price: The annual median listing price of housing in New York.
3. Unemployment Rate: The annual unemployment rate for New York residents.
4. Gasoline Retail Prices: The weekly average of gasoline retail prices regionally in the state of New York.

These datasets were chosen because they provide a clear picture of economic trends affecting cost of living. Analyzing them together allows for exploration of the relationships between income, housing, employment, and gas prices.
