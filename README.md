### Region: New York, USA
The state of New York is a highly industrialized, densely populated are with diverse economic and housing trends. I chose this region for the project due to its blend of urban and rural areas (especially with the inclusion of major city, New York City), allowing for analysis of cost-of-living factors like household income, housing prices, and unemployment rates. This data can help better understand the economic pressures of being a resident of New York.

### Datasets
The analysis utilizes three datasets that detail various economic metrics over time:
1. Median Household Income: The annual median income for households across New York.
2. Median Housing Price: The annual median listing price of housing in New York.
3. Unemployment Rate: The annual unemployment rate for New York residents.

These datasets were chosen because they provide a clear picture of economic trends affecting cost of living. Analyzing them together allows for exploration of the relationships between income, housing, and employment.

### Data Source
**Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED)**
- Real Median Household Income in New York (MEHOINUSNYA672N)
- Housing Inventory: Median Listing Price in New York (MEDLISPRINY)
- Unemployment Rate in New York (NYUR)


### Strategies from "Storytelling With Data"
- **Clarity and simplicity:** Using clear labels and concise axes to avoid confustion and keeping visualization simple to avoid unnecesary distractions.
- **Effective use of color:** Using color to distinguish between variables and allow for easy comparison to differentiate between trends.
- **Interactivity:** Interactive components like year range slider and dropdown menus allow users to explore data at different levels.

### Example Scenarios
1. Comparing Housing and Income Trends Over Time: A user can compare trends in the median household income and median housing prices over the years to assess whether housing prices are growing disproportionately to income.
2. Understanding Relationship Between Unemployment and Housing Prices: A user can explore how periods of high employment correlate with dips or increases in housing prices, providing insights into how the job market affects the housing sector.
3. Slopegraph for Year-to-Year Change: By using two dropdowns to select different years, users can visualize the year-to-year changes in key indicators like income and housing prices to gain an understanding of how the economy is evolving over time.
